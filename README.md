## TLE Extended

TLE Extended is a compatible extended fork of Traffic Lights Enhancement for Cities: Skylines II. It starts from the rewritten TLE codebase and adds Tram Signal Priority, with a longer-term focus on compatibility, maintainability, documentation, diagnostics, and broader transit-priority work.

Current capabilities include:

* Set traffic lights to predefined signal modes.
* Configure custom traffic-light phases at supported junctions.
* Enable optional Tram Signal Priority on selected intersections.
* Use opt-in diagnostics when investigating Tram Signal Priority behavior.

See the [guide](GUIDE.md) and [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for the current direction of the project.

## Status

This repository is public, but TLE Extended is not currently being publicized or published on Paradox Mods. For now, treat it as a source-built local mod for testing and development.

Compatibility with the current Cities: Skylines II version should be verified before any public release.

## Compatibility

TLE Extended is intended to be a drop-in replacement for Traffic Lights Enhancement. A city with intersections already configured in TLE should continue to load and preserve those intersection settings when switching to TLE Extended.

The mod stores extra data in saves to provide additional functionality. If the mod is removed, traffic lights and junctions should usually revert to default settings when a road update is triggered, but this cannot be guaranteed.

You should not downgrade a save from TLE Extended to an older TLE build after saving with this fork. Cities saved with newer data may not be compatible with previous versions.

> [!WARNING]
> These modifications are experimental. Back up important saves before testing, especially while TLE Extended is still source-built and not packaged for public release.

## Installation

TLE Extended is not currently distributed through Paradox Mods. Build it from source and install it as a [local mod](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Modding_Toolchain#Local_Mods_Location).

Build instructions are available in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Translations

This fork inherits Traffic Lights Enhancement's localization structure and Crowdin workflow. Some inherited strings intentionally use English fallback text until translations are available. New or changed user-facing strings should follow the existing localization files and avoid ad-hoc translation churn.
