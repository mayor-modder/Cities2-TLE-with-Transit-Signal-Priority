# Traffic Groups

Traffic groups are inherited Traffic Lights Enhancement behavior for coordinating
multiple signalized junctions. TLE Extended keeps this save/component model for
drop-in compatibility, and Tram Signal Priority builds around it rather than
rewriting it.

This document is maintainer-facing. It describes the current implementation,
not an idealized design.

## Source Map

- `TrafficLightsEnhancement/Components/TrafficGroup.cs`
  stores group-wide coordination settings and runtime master-clock fields.
- `TrafficLightsEnhancement/Components/TrafficGroupMember.cs`
  marks a junction as a member of a group and stores leader, index, offset, and
  per-member timing data.
- `TrafficLightsEnhancement/Components/TrafficGroupName.cs`
  stores the group name in fixed `ulong` fields while serializing as a string.
- `TrafficLightsEnhancement/Components/TrafficGroupTspDebugState.cs`
  is reserved for group-level TSP diagnostics.
- `TrafficLightsEnhancement/Systems/TrafficGroupSystem.cs`
  owns group creation, membership changes, leader selection, green-wave timing,
  master-clock capture, and follower coordination.
- `TrafficLightsEnhancement/Systems/UI/UISystem.UIBIndings.cs`
  exposes traffic group data and mutation triggers to the React UI.
- `TrafficLightsEnhancement/Systems/TrafficLightSystems/Simulation/CustomStateMachine.cs`
  and `PatchedTrafficLightSystem.cs` use the group state when updating signal
  phases.

## Data Model

`TrafficGroup` is a component on a synthetic group entity, not on the junction
itself. It stores:

- whether coordination is enabled
- whether green wave timing is enabled
- green-wave speed, offset, and maximum coordination distance
- creation time and cycle length
- runtime-only master signal state copied from the leader each frame

Only the persisted settings are serialized. The master-clock fields are
runtime-only and are rebuilt from the leader.

`TrafficGroupMember` is a component on each junction node in the group. It
stores:

- the group entity
- the current leader entity
- the member index
- distance/offset/signal-delay values used by green-wave timing
- a per-member cycle timer
- `m_IsGroupLeader`, which makes one junction authoritative for the group

The first junction added to an empty group becomes the leader. If the leader is
removed, `TrafficGroupSystem.AssignNewLeader(...)` promotes another member and
updates every member's `m_LeaderEntity`.

`TrafficGroupName` stores up to 64 characters internally and serializes as one
string. It is unversioned in the save format.

## UI Flow

The Traffic Groups panel is built in `UISystem.UIBIndings.cs` when
`m_MainPanelState == MainPanelState.TrafficGroups`.

The backend sends each group as `UITypes.ItemTrafficGroup`, including:

- group entity identity and name
- member count
- coordination and green-wave settings
- current junction membership/leader status
- current junction delay/offset data
- member list with phase counts and available pattern options
- cycle length

The same binding file handles UI triggers for:

- creating and deleting groups
- adding/removing the selected junction
- renaming groups
- setting the leader
- toggling coordination and green wave
- editing speed, offset, cycle length, and signal delay
- calculating delays
- selecting group members from the panel

When a selected junction is a group follower, the main panel marks TSP as
non-editable and shows the "controlled by the group leader" status. This avoids
letting a follower appear to own behavior that is actually driven by the
leader.

## Runtime Behavior

`TrafficGroupSystem.OnUpdate()` runs for coordinated groups. Each tick it:

1. Advances the group cycle timer.
2. Captures the leader's current signal group, next signal group, state, timer,
   signal group count, and custom timer into the group master-clock fields.
3. Applies coordination to followers.

When green wave is disabled, followers use the job-level
`SyncSignalGroupWithLeader(...)` path and copy the leader phase/state/timers
directly.

When green wave is enabled, followers use offset-based timing. Signal delays and
phase offsets are used to stagger member cycle positions while staying tied to
the leader's cycle.

Adding a junction to a group also ensures the junction has the core TLE custom
traffic-light data it needs:

- `CustomTrafficLights`
- `CustomPhaseData`
- `EdgeGroupMask`
- `SubLaneGroupMask`

If the junction is already in a custom traffic mode that is not dynamic or fixed
timed, the group system switches it to dynamic mode.

## TSP Interaction

TSP is intentionally leader-only for grouped intersections today.

`TransitSignalPriorityRuntime.IsRuntimeEligibleJunction(...)` returns false for
group members where `m_IsGroupLeader` is false. The approach-index eligibility
job in `PatchedTrafficLightSystem` uses the same idea so a follower-only TSP
setting does not cause unnecessary approach-index work.

This is conservative but important:

- Followers are driven by the leader, so a local follower request could not
  safely select its own signal group.
- Routing follower requests to the leader would need explicit conflict and
  diagnostics semantics.
- Group-level TSP propagation is not currently active; old serialized
  scaffolding is read for compatibility where needed, but not used for behavior.

Future group-wide TSP should define how requests from followers are promoted to
the leader, how diagnostics explain that promotion, and how pedestrian fairness
works across the whole group.

## Save Compatibility

Traffic group data is part of the inherited TLE save surface. TLE Extended
should preserve it when a user switches from upstream TLE.

Current persisted components:

- `TrafficGroup`: versioned group settings. The runtime master-clock fields are
  not serialized.
- `TrafficGroupMember`: versioned member data. V1 data defaults
  `m_MemberCycleTimer`; V2 stores it explicitly.
- `TrafficGroupName`: unversioned group name string.

The migration and cleanup path validates group references and removes or resets
invalid group data rather than changing the format casually. See
`docs/save-format-contract.md` and `docs/serialization-and-migration-audit.md`
before touching these components.

Compatibility rules for future work:

- Do not remove or rename these components without an explicit save-format
  migration.
- Do not make follower-local behavior authoritative without a documented group
  semantics change.
- Keep group membership and leader fields stable for users moving from upstream
  TLE to TLE Extended.
- Treat group-wide TSP or bus priority as new behavior that needs opt-in
  controls, diagnostics, and tests.

## Known Maintenance Notes

- `TrafficGroupSystem.cs` is large and mixes group lifecycle, green-wave math,
  leader synchronization, UI-serving helpers, and maintenance operations.
- Several operations scan all group members through entity queries. This is
  acceptable for current scale, but future performance work should preserve
  save compatibility first.
- Group behavior is hard to reason about without in-game context. Prefer adding
  pure tests and small docs before changing runtime behavior.
