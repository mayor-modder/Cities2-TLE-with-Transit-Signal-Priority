# Save Format Contract

This document is the maintainer-facing compatibility contract for TLE Extended
save data. It lists the current serialized surface, the payload versions that
must remain readable, and the runtime fields that are intentionally not saved.

TLE Extended is intended to load saves created with bruceyboy's Traffic Lights
Enhancement while this fork remains in drop-in compatibility mode. Saves written
by TLE Extended may include additive TSP data and should not be treated as
downgrade-safe for older TLE builds once users enable new Extended features.

## Versioning Rules

`TLEDataMigrationSystem` writes the global data version
`TLEDataVersion.Current`, currently `V5`. On load, that global version drives
the migration plan documented in
[`serialization-and-migration-audit.md`](serialization-and-migration-audit.md).

Component payload versions are not always the same as the global migration
version:

- `CustomTrafficLights` writes the current global version, currently `V5`.
- Several inherited components write `V1` or `V2` payloads.
- `TransitSignalPrioritySettings` writes its own integer payload version, `2`.
- `TrafficGroupName` has no explicit payload version.
- `CustomLaneDirection` in the shared lane-system library uses a sentinel plus
  schema version instead of `TLEDataVersion`.

Future save changes should document whether a version bump is a global
migration step, a component payload change, or both. Readers currently do not
have generic skip logic for unknown future payload fields, so forward
compatibility must be designed explicitly.

## Saved Payloads

| Type | Kind | Current payload | Serialized fields |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TLEDataMigrationSystem` | global system | `TLEDataVersion.Current` (`V5`) | Global loaded data version only. |
| `CustomTrafficLights` | component on junction node | `V5` | `m_Pattern`, `m_PedestrianPhaseDurationMultiplier`, `m_PedestrianPhaseGroupMask`, `m_Timer`, `m_ManualSignalGroup`, `m_Mode`, `m_Options`. |
| `CustomPhaseData` | dynamic buffer on junction node | `V2` | V1 timing, demand, priority, options, duration, and multiplier fields; V2 bicycle occupancy, phase-change metric, wait/flow balance, open/close delays, vehicle weights, smoothing, next-step reference, and current flow/wait. |
| `EdgeGroupMask` | dynamic buffer on junction node | `V2` | Edge, position, options, car/public-car/track turn masks, stop-line and non-stop pedestrian masks, unified pedestrian mask, bicycle mask, open/close delay. |
| `SubLaneGroupMask` | dynamic buffer on junction node | `V1` | Sublane, position, options, car turn mask, track turn mask, pedestrian signal mask. |
| `GroupMask.Signal` | nested serializable value | `V2` | Go group mask, yield group mask, open delay, close delay. |
| `GroupMask.Turn` | nested serializable value | `V1` | Left, straight, right, and U-turn `GroupMask.Signal` values. |
| `SignalDelayData` | dynamic buffer on junction node | `V1` | Edge, open delay, close delay, enabled flag. |
| `ExtraLaneSignal` | component on sublane | `V1` | Yield group mask, ignore-priority group mask, source sublane. |
| `LaneFlowHistory` | component on sublane | `V1` | Duration vector, distance vector, frame. |
| `TrafficGroup` | component on group entity | `V1` | Coordinated flag, green-wave enabled flag, green-wave speed, green-wave offset, max coordination distance, creation time, cycle length. |
| `TrafficGroupMember` | component on junction node | `V2` | Group entity, leader entity, group index, distance to group center, distance to leader, phase offset, signal delay, member cycle timer, leader flag. |
| `TrafficGroupName` | component on group entity | unversioned | One string, packed internally into eight `ulong` fields. |
| `TransitSignalPrioritySettings` | component on junction node | `2` | Enabled flag, allow-track flag, allow-public-car flag, request horizon ticks, max green extension ticks. |
| `CustomLaneDirection` | dynamic buffer from `CommonLibraries/LaneSystem` | schema `3` | Sentinel `float.MaxValue`, schema version, position, tangent, group index, lane index, four restriction booleans, owner entity. |

## Legacy Reads

`CustomTrafficLights` supports several inherited payload layouts:

- `V1` and earlier consumed fifteen legacy pattern entries and now reset the
  pattern to `Vanilla`.
- `V2` reads only the pattern.
- `V3` adds pedestrian phase duration and pedestrian phase group mask.
- `V4` adds timer and manual signal group.
- `V5` adds mode and options.

`CustomPhaseData` reads `V1` payloads and initializes all `V2` additions to the
same defaults used by a newly-created phase.

`EdgeGroupMask` reads `V1` payloads by deriving the unified pedestrian mask from
the stop-line and non-stop pedestrian masks. Bicycle and open/close delay fields
default to zero.

`GroupMask.Signal` reads `V1` payloads by defaulting open/close delays to zero.

`TrafficGroupMember` reads `V1` payloads by defaulting
`m_MemberCycleTimer` to `0`.

`TrafficGroup` currently writes `V1`, but reads and discards one extra bool for
payloads marked `V2` or newer. Older TSP builds serialized group propagation in
that slot. TLE Extended intentionally keeps propagation inactive, so the field is
discarded instead of reintroduced.

`TransitSignalPrioritySettings` supports TSP payload `1` and `2`. Payload `1`
contains an extra bool between `m_AllowPublicCarRequests` and
`m_RequestHorizonTicks`; the current reader consumes and discards it. Versions
below `1` remain at default settings.

`CustomLaneDirection` supports:

- schema `1`: raw position followed by four restriction booleans,
- schema `2`: sentinel, schema, position, tangent, group index, lane index, and
  restrictions, with owner defaulted to `Entity.Null`,
- schema `3`: schema `2` plus owner.

## Normalization And Validation

TSP settings normalize after load:

- request horizon `0` and the legacy default `120` become `10`,
- request horizon values above `120` clamp to `120`,
- max green extension `0` becomes `45`,
- max green extension values above `600` clamp to `600`.

Loaded TSP settings are not forced back to tram-only defaults. The serialized
track/public-car flags are part of the payload contract even though the runtime
currently only produces track requests.

The migration/validation pass also repairs inherited data where possible:

- invalid signal-delay edges are removed and delay values clamp to `0..300`,
- invalid `TrafficGroupMember` references or negative values are removed or
  reset,
- invalid `TrafficGroup` timing/distances reset to defaults,
- invalid `CustomTrafficLights` enum values reset and affected intersections
  are recorded for UI notice,
- orphaned custom phase/mask buffers can recreate a default
  `CustomTrafficLights` component so the user can inspect and repair them.

## Runtime-Only Fields

The following fields or components are intentionally transient and should not be
treated as save data:

- `TrafficGroup.m_LastSyncTime`, `m_CycleTimer`, and all `m_Master*` clock
  fields. They are recomputed by group synchronization at runtime.
- `TransitSignalPriorityRequest`, the latched current request state.
- `TransitSignalPriorityRuntimeDebugInfo`, selected-intersection probe and
  candidate diagnostics.
- `TransitSignalPriorityDecisionTrace`, final TSP decision diagnostics.
- `TrafficGroupTspDebugState`, group-level TSP diagnostics.
- JSONL TSP diagnostics files under `Application.persistentDataPath`; these are
  opt-in debugging artifacts, not save data.

`LaneFlowHistory` and several `CustomPhaseData` flow/wait fields are saved by
the current code even though they are measurement-like. Treat them as part of the
current payload until a migration explicitly removes or recomputes them.

## Compatibility Expectations

TLE Extended should preserve these assumptions while in drop-in mode:

- Existing saves from supported TLE versions load without user action.
- Existing TLE intersections without `TransitSignalPrioritySettings` behave as
  non-TSP intersections.
- TSP is additive per junction; disabling TSP removes the settings component and
  leaves inherited TLE data intact.
- Grouped follower intersections do not run local TSP. Leader/follower TSP
  behavior needs a new explicit design before any save fields are added.
- Public-car/bus priority fields are reserved. Making them user-configurable may
  need a TSP payload bump and migration notes.
- Downgrading an Extended save to upstream TLE is not guaranteed after Extended
  has written components unknown to the target upstream build.

Before changing any serialized field order, type, version, or normalization
rule, add or update serializer fixtures in
`TrafficLightsEnhancement.Serialization.Tests` and update this contract.
