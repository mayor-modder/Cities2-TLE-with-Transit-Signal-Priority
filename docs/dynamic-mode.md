# Dynamic Mode Behavior

This document explains the inherited dynamic custom phase behavior after the
upstream rewrite and records interactions that matter for TSP.

## Ownership

Dynamic mode is implemented in `CustomStateMachine` and configured by
`CustomPhaseData` plus `CustomTrafficLights`.

Key responsibilities:

- `CustomPhaseData` stores per-phase timing, demand, priority, and vehicle
  weight fields.
- `CustomTrafficLights` stores the selected custom traffic light mode.
- `CustomStateMachine` refreshes demand/flow metrics, advances the current
  custom phase state, and selects the next signal group.

## Phase Order

Dynamic mode cycles through user-defined custom phases in order. Next-phase
selection scans forward from the current phase and wraps around the phase
buffer.

Eligibility:

- phases with `m_MinimumDuration > 0` are always eligible
- phases with `m_MinimumDuration == 0` are skippable
- zero-minimum phases run when they have demand, currently priority or occupied
  weighted lanes
- if every phase is skippable and has no demand, dynamic mode falls back to the
  next sequential phase so the state machine does not stall

This is separate from fixed timed mode's optional smart phase selection.

## Linked Phases

The `LinkedWithNextPhase` flag links a phase to the phase immediately after it.
The restored runtime behavior is intentionally narrow:

- fixed and dynamic mode first compute their normal base next phase
- if the current phase starts a linked chain, the selector can advance through
  that chain to the first later linked phase with priority or waiting demand
- if normal selection lands after a linked predecessor that has priority or
  waiting demand, the selector rewinds to that predecessor so the linked block
  starts at the front
- linked adjustment does not wrap around the end of the phase list
- if TSP changes the linked base selection, the `linked` flag is cleared so
  linked-phase counter resets do not run for the TSP-selected phase

When a linked transition skips an unprioritized phase inside the linked block,
that skipped phase's `m_TurnsSinceLastRun` value is reset. This preserves the
inherited fairness hook without reintroducing the old pre-rewrite selector.

## Phase Duration

Each phase is bounded by its configured minimum and maximum duration.

- Before or at minimum duration, the current phase does not end.
- At or beyond maximum duration, the current phase ends.
- Between those bounds, dynamic mode uses the selected phase-change metric plus
  measured flow and wait values to decide whether the phase may end.

The duration fields are signal update ticks, not wall-clock seconds. The custom
state machine increments `CustomTrafficLights.m_Timer` once when that junction's
traffic light update runs, then compares the counter directly to
`m_MinimumDuration`, `m_MaximumDuration`, and the computed target duration. The
current UI labels these values with `s`, but there is no seconds conversion in
the runtime or persistence path.

The target duration calculation is:

```text
10 * (average car flow + track lane occupied * 0.5) * target duration multiplier
```

The target is not a hard duration. It delays ending a still-prioritized phase
until the timer passes the target and the low-flow counter accumulates. A
higher-priority competing phase can still end the current phase sooner through
the low-priority counter.

## Phase Change Metrics

`CustomPhaseData.StepChangeMetric` controls the mid-range change policy:

- `Default`: change when flow is lower than weighted wait
- `FirstFlow`: change when flow exists
- `FirstWait`: change when waiting demand exists
- `NoFlow`: change when current flow is absent
- `NoWait`: change when waiting demand elsewhere is absent

Dynamic wait is based on the maximum waiting value from other phases, multiplied
by `m_WaitFlowBalance`.

## Demand And Flow Refresh

Before the state machine advances, `CalculatePriority(...)` refreshes lane
demand and priority:

- resets occupied-lane counters
- reads lane petitioners and priorities
- counts cars, public cars, tracks, pedestrians, and bicycle lanes per signal
  group
- calculates weighted waiting and flow/wait ratios

`CalculateFlow(...)` samples lane flow history only for lanes served by the
current signal group.

## UI Persistence

The UI exposes dynamic settings for phase change mode, wait sensitivity,
minimum duration, maximum duration, target duration multiplier, interval
exponent, vehicle weights, smoothing factor, and live statistics.

The C# update helper persists:

- mode
- minimum and maximum duration
- target duration multiplier
- interval exponent
- linked/end-prematurely flags
- change metric
- wait-flow balance
- visible vehicle weight sliders
- smoothing factor

Min/max edits clamp each other so `minimum <= maximum`, and group cycle length
is recalculated when either duration changes.

The data model also contains `m_BicycleWeight`, the shared update helper applies
the `BicycleWeight` key, and the dynamic-mode vehicle-weight foldout exposes a
visible Bicycle Weight slider.

## TSP Interaction

`PatchedTrafficLightSystem` resolves a local TSP request before custom phase
simulation and passes it into `CustomStateMachine.UpdateTrafficLightState(...)`.

During an ongoing custom phase:

- if the current group already serves the TSP request, TSP can hold that group
  up to the max green extension limit
- if the phase is ending or selecting the next group, dynamic mode first
  computes its base sequential/demand-aware group, then TSP may override that
  selected group to the requested tram-serving group
- if the request targets the current phase, next-phase override is skipped and
  current-phase holding handles it

Exclusive pedestrian protection applies to custom phases. When exclusive
pedestrian mode is enabled and the active ongoing group is a pedestrian phase,
TSP may hold that same group when compatible but should not preempt away to a
different target group.

## Coordinated Traffic Groups

Coordinated followers do not run independent phase timing. They mirror the
leader through `SyncSignalGroupWithLeader(...)`.

- Without green wave, followers copy leader phase, state, and timers directly.
- With green wave, followers map leader phase and next phase through
  `m_PhaseOffset` and subtract signal delay from timers.
- The UI displays leader phase settings read-only for coordinated followers.

Current TSP runtime rejects non-leader grouped intersections. This is the
intended short-term behavior: coordinated followers are driven by the leader, so
a follower-local TSP request should remain ignored rather than being routed to a
leader implicitly. Future group-wide TSP needs explicit leader/follower
semantics.
